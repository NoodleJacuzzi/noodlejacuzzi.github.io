Travel between the complex and the school interacting with characters to improve their trust score until they're fully yours. Then, various scenes are unlocked by interacting with that character or by inviting them on events.
Each character has an individual plotline and story divided into two halves: The trust phase, and the addicted phase.
Wander around town and the school improving techniques, collecting money and items, and talking to characters

	Scene list
		Purple1A
			You see her in the classroom, note her failing grades and how her father left the country, and can offer to counsel her.
		Purple1B
			You're sent her file, note her failing grades and how her father left the country, and can call her in for counseling.
		Purple2A
			You see her in the morning as she's leaving and ask to speak with her mother.
		Purple2B
			You catch her as she's leaving, and ask to walk home with her to meet her mother.
		Purple3
			You have a sit down and ask what she is struggling with. You can either help her work through her schoolwork (purple3A) or offer to talk about her feelings (purple3B). You also learn her favorite flower is a purple one, and the purple flower is unlocked in the store.
		Purple3A
			You help her through her schoolwork, either guiding her towards the correct path (+5 trust) or working through the path for her (+10 trust)
		Purple3B
			You offer to talk her through her feelings. You can either push her towards meditation (+5 trust) or allow her to vent (+10 trust)
		Purple4
			She's struggling to put what you've mentioned into practice (calming down and working through things one at a time). You can spend a few hours working with her to learn patience.
		Purple5
			You bring up the idea of hypnotism, but she isn't open enough to you yet. She asks if she should hate her father, and you can either tell her to bear that anger (+10 trust) or throw it away as worthless (+5 trust).
		Purple6
			She's having trouble taking your previous advice, and is finally open to a bit of hypnosis. You can spend the day planting the seed to allow for full control.
		Purple7
			Her mind is finally clear, and she's open to taking you home for a more in-depth hypnosis session.
			

Chubby
	Encounters
		Level 3 (auto set to level 3 after purple level 2)
			Vintage Street - morning
				Chubby1
					She welcomes you back in and the two of you talk over tea. She asks if purple is a bother, and you can either respond that working through her issues will take time (chubby1A) or that everything is going well (chubby1B)
				Chubby1A
					She responds knowingly, saying that her father left her with quite a few issues. You can tell her you have a plan (+5 trust) or tell her that, while you will help, purple's future depends on a strong family relationship to fall back on (+10 trust).
				Chubby1B
					She's glad purple is doing well, since purple's growing distant. You can either tell her you have a plan to help with that (+5 trust), or you can help her work out how to communicate more effectively with purple (+10 trust).
				Chubby2 (optional, only if 1 is failed)
					She offers you tea again, and asks you to spend some time going over exactly what your plan is.
				Chubby3
					She invites you to walk through town with her, and confides that she just doesn't know what to do. You can either comfort her emotionally (+5 trust) or you can offer hypnosis as a suggestion (+10 trust).
				Chubby4 (optional, only if 3 is failed)
					She invites you in, apologizing for how she reacted before. She wants to become as good at emotional management as you, so you can offer to train her. At the end of the training, you offer hypnosis as a method to understand herself better.
				Chubby5
					She's open to the idea of a full hypnosis session, and offers you free reign of her mind.
	Notes
		She sleeps through the evenings, so says her logbook
		You can buy the purple flower after purple3, which can trigger chubby6 at any time after chubby1 (skipping immediately to 100 trust)
