				t And it all just clicked.

				pinstripe Sho... Thick...
				t Her mind is quiet, for once. Of couse no rational thought could survive in an environment like this. It'd be silenced, then beaten down with every white flash of light of pleasure that shakes her body every time she can feel your full, throbbing cock inside of her.
				t You can feel yourself approaching the edge. You give a token resistance, with your hands rather than words of course. She obviously isn't listening to reason anymore.
				t But no dice. Pushing her fat asscheeks back for a moment of reprieve only makes her try to bounce harder. So...
				im cowgirl3.jpg
				t There's a very brief moment of hesitation when your first spurt of cum hits the entrance to her womb. But then she resumes. It isn't clear if she's riding out as much pleasure as she can get, or if she's actively milking you for all you've got.
