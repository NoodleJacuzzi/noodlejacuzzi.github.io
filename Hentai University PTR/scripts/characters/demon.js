				t With how you last saw demonF, you wouldn't be surprised if he ended up in a jail cell since the last time you saw him. You decide to go check up on his hotel, and see how it's changed since your last visit.
				...
				t Not very much. The place looks almost identical, although there's a different demon boi here in the lobby.
				im images/demon/darkProfile.jpg
				sp Black-Haired Succubus; im images/demon/dark.jpg; Oh, why hello there. Are you here for business, or for pleasure? We aren't taking new customers at the moment, but if you're just browsing I can introduce you to some very antsy-
				sp player; I'm here to speak with demonF, is he here?
				t His seductive gaze completely falters.
				sp Black-Haired Succubus; im images/demon/dark.jpg; The master? Oh my, I'm terribly sorry to waste your time.
				t He steps out from behind the desk, his sandals clacking against the floor. 
				sp Black-Haired Succubus; im images/demon/dark.jpg; The master is in his suite. Here, I'll guide you.
				t He leads you to the elevator. With a wave of his hand the doors slide open.
				...
				t The ride is silent and awkward. In such a cramped space you can clearly smell something like perfume, your guide smells kinda like raw, concentrated desperation, which happens to smell like citrus.
				t The elevator comes to a stop at the top floor before you can break the ice.
				sp Black-Haired Succubus; im images/demon/dark.jpg; He's just a few doors down, it's the one with the golden marker.
				sp player; Thanks, take care.
				t He bows, despite his best efforts he seems nervous about something.
				t Pressing on, you head into demonF's room.
				...
				t You give a knock on the large, gaudy door. It's opened almost immediately. The smell of sex flows over you like a wave, it's enough to make your head spin.
				sp demon; Ooh~! I knew it was you! I've been waiting for days! You must've been really excited by my little text, hmm? I've got the perfect thing right in here... Somewhere... Don't mind the mess.
				t He walks back into his room. The place is a wreck, the room is coated in the familiar scent of demon jizz and saliva. 
				sp player; I didn't get any, I was coming to see if you'd been arrested yet.
				sp demon; Wha? Did your little bat not pass it along to you? I must've sent you hundreds of... Here!
				t He throws aside a wooden paddle and pulls out a wig of red hair, thankfully saved from being coated like other areas of the room.
				sp player; Christ, what happened here?
				sp demon; Do you like it? Before I got bored and started cumming in public, I had some fun with just about anything I could find. Buttplugs, dildos, my bedpost, chastity cages weren't any fun though since I don't care about cumming with my dick. Here!
				t He tosses you the wig.
				sp demon; You didn't play with me before since you were scared of being arrested, yeah? This is really strong. A cop could be slapping cuffs on you and they'd forget you before the locks even go click. We could do anything, anywhere, and there wouldn't be a single consequence in the world for you. Now we can play all we want!
				t You put on the wig, nothing happens. Out of the corner of your eye you see a standing mirror. In the areas not coated with demonF's wasted jizz, you see an unfamiliar face staring back at you.
				sp player; And what about you? 
				sp demon; Well, that's up to you, isn't it? Knowing you could just leave me anywhere...
				t His eyes go manic for a second and he actually shivers as his imagination runs wild. Clearly exerting some self control he does his best to keep trying to keep focused on the negotiation. 
				sp demon; You can take it with you. Lately I've been having some security issues with some of the fun toys I've collected over the years. Your familiar wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would he? <br>Well, whatever. The point is it needs a demon's touch to work. So, what do you say? Take a cute girl out on the town, we could have some f... Fun... We'd feel really good together... 
				t It's clear at this point his cracks are starting to show as he takes a few steps forward towards you. He's no longer able to conceal the manic greed in his eyes. His negotiation skills are seriously deteriorating like your presence is like you're waving a hit in front of an addict. 
				t As he gets closer you push him down like you would a dog to get some breathing room, he rubs his face against your palm and with his bow-legged sitting position her's humping the ground as he breaths in your scent. 
				sp demon; Ngggh~! Cmon~! I haven't cum yet today~! Well, aside from when I thought about where you'd take me~!
				sp player; Come on, get a hold of yourself. What would your employees think if they saw you right now?
				t His breathing and thrusting grow more erratic, until you hear him whimper into your hand. He's off in his own little world as his thrusts start to slow down and he's more slowly grinding his crotch into the floor than humping. There's a subtle smell about him now.
				sp player; Did... Did you just cum from that? 
				sp demon; Ehe... Ehehe... 
				t He gently lays backwards, content to lie on the floor with a starstruck expression on his face. No longer able to keep up with you in conversation.
				t With an extra hit of demon jizz fueling the smell of many, many shamegasms in the room, you stumble out. Dating a fap-junkie femboi could be fun, although you get the impression that demonF isn't really after capturing a romantic relationship. 
				t If you want to, you could come back sometime and see what kind of events demonF has planned for the two of you.

				t Out of the corner of your eye you can see a dark spot form on the front of his short shorts, but from the look in his eye it's clear he isn't satisfied yet.
				t Soon the crowd around you is moving to follow the excited sea life, while you and demonF are staying behind.
				...
				im images/demon/aqua5.jpg
				sp demon; Come on, hurry up~! You're just gonna tease your date? Fuck that~!
				sp player; God damn you are insatiable.
				sp demon; Yeah yeah, life's a sassy, fat-bottomed bitch. Fuck me. Right. Now.
				t You have no idea how this boi, bent over against the glass wagging his ass like a bitch in heat has taken a dominant position here, but you don't intend to let him keep it. 
				im images/demon/aqua6.jpg
				sp demon; Oooh~<br>That's it, that's what the dildo can't match...
				t Just sliding your cock into the little brat has your vision start to swim a little. Little Ms. Anal Whore here might have shattered his bravado on your cock, but he's still got an ass that won't quit.
				sp demon; G-good *boy, thrust deeper...<br>Give my greedy hole the relief it needs, make me spurt like one of your common bitches~
				sp player; You... Hrg... Are a common bitch, demonF...
				sp demon; Some bite~! But I can hear from your voice you're barely holding on~!<br>Stop thinking, just turn off your brain and beat my ass into the ground, show my whimpy little nutsack how a <i>real</i> cock-
				im images/demon/aqua7.jpg
				t His voice and attitude are smashed flat as you become a primal, thrusting mess, but more importantly is when he can feel the first shot of the cum you intend to paint his asshole white with.
				im images/demon/aqua8.jpg
				sp demon; GHHH~! GHHHHHUMMMIN'~!
				t If he were still wearing shorts they'd be soaked through right now. The only thing on his mind is total bliss. If he's still aware of where the two of you are, it's only making him cum harder. His volume control has shut off completely.
				t As you fire off your last shot of cum you pull out, lest his incredible ass milk you completely dry.
				im images/demon/aqua9.jpg
				t Even as you can hear shouts and realize you've been noticed, he's still panting like a bitch in heat and leaking from his cocklette.
				t While you're safe from consequences thanks to your wig, he isn't. Thinking quickly, you zip up and pick up the barely lucid boi like you would a big bag of flour.
				...
				sp player; Jesus, you're still out of it?
				sp demon; Ehehe, cumming feelsh gewd~
				t Even as you were carrying him to safety once his post-orgasmic haze mostly wore off, he just used the opportunity to start jerking off while rubbing against you however he could.
				sp player; Honestly demonF, you're gonna get into serious trouble one of these days. What'll you do then?
				sp demon; Cum~! I'll cum lotsh and lotsh~!
				t You just sigh. Now that you're out of trouble you can just set him down somewhere secluded.

				t You decided to for a walk in the forest. It seems a bit tame for his usual antics, but demonF is excited nonetheless.
				...
				sp demon; I-it's quite dark this deep in the forest, quite cold too.
				sp player; Really? Feels fine to me.
				im images/demon/forest1.jpg
				sp demon; W-well maybe that's because you have more clothes than me. Maybe we should huddle together to war-
				sp player; demonF, you're drenched in sweat.
				im images/demon/forest2.jpg
				sp demon; Fiiiine. Honestly, how are your predator instincts not kicking in? A cutie like me, so defenseless. 
				t He pouts, but his true intentions are clear from his body language. At this point he's broken enough that he treats his dick like a tail to be wagged when happy.
				t You're enjoying stringing him along, but each time you inhale you catch a whiff of the smell of his sweat. It's... Sweet. Not chocolate sin like succubusF, more like honey. Just focusing on the smell makes your legs feel wobbly.
				sp demon; You're sweating yourself you know. The walk too much for little old you?
				sp player; Please... I could do this all night...
				t But he's actually pretty on the mark. You can't keep walking much longer. Not from exhaustion, but because of the opposite instead.
				...
				im images/demon/forest3.jpg
				sp demon; Raaape~! The b-ggggh~! The big scary man's pounding my bitch button~!
				sp player; Shut up!
				sp demon; Ooough~! If you want me quiet, stop rewarding me for screaming~! Balls deep, that's what it'll take!
				t He announces every word loud enough it feels like the entire forest can hear him. He must've chosen this location so he could scream his lungs out without holding back.
				t So you pick up the pace and force his voice to go up an octave or two. Being exposed to the scent of raw, concentrated sexual perfection for so long, it's no wonder you're turning into a sexual beast right now.
				sp demon; Give up! Pump that wonderful jizz into me, and do it fast or I'll make your precious succubusF suck it out of me while I suck-<br>OOOOUGH~!
				im images/demon/forest4.jpg
				t You're a primal mess of a blur right now, taking out your frustrations on what is essential a stress toy and an onahole in the shape of a squealing brat.
				im images/demon/forest5.jpg
				sp demon; Oh, oh I feel it~ It's cumming~!
				im images/demon/forest6.jpg
				t As you start to come back to reality he's already leaving it. Cum drools down his thighs and wasted jizz leaks from his cock. His eyes squint shut and open again as his pupils dilate, and any attempts at further screaming are just soundless gasps of a bitch drowning in pleasure.
				t You stumble back as his body is still being wracked with aftershocks, cum is leaking from his less-than-modest dick in a solid clear stream. He twitches and breathes erratically, only able to communicate one thing; You'll need to carry him out of the woods.
				...
				t Luckily the forest is surrounded on all sides by civilization. As your reputation is protected by the wig and his reputation isn't worth shit, you make your way back to his hotel without incident, even if you get a lot of shocked looks along the way.
