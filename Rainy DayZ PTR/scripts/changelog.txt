This is Rainy DayZ, an HTML game created by me, Noodle Jacuzzi. Play it, and my other titles via the master index at https://noodlejacuzzi.github.io/index.html
Please note that this may only be a temporary hosting method.

In a world where a zombie virus has spread, transforming people into voracious sex-hungry shemales, you play as a young woman searching for supplies to survive.
This all might be familiar to you if you've checked out my other work, Human Alteration App, because Rainy DayZ was originally a minigame. For various reasons I've needed to trim off the minigames from HAA into their own titles, so here we are! I can assure you though that there both is and will be enough content to justify this game being its own title.

This game focuses heavily on themes of rape and shemale-zombification, and includes optional content depicting bestiality, rimming, and sounding. It's made to be similar in tone to Futa Apocalypse.

If you're here from HAA, there's no new content here yet. My plan is to release a content patch after working more on HAA which will finish all of the game's 6 unfinished scenes.

Current Version: Beta v1

All you need to do is download this. Extract the game files to create the Rainy DayZ folder, then run the Rainy DayZ.html file. If errors begin popping up, I might need to separate the game files from the images.
