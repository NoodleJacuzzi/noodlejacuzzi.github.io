					t Even if we make the nymphs dislike pissing on or in already infected individuals, other infected quickly realize the nymphs can be forced to urinate if subjected to prostate stimulation. Thus results in a large-form gangrape until the nymph admits total defeat and wets herself before quickly being licked clean. This continues until the nymph can no longer hold back from spraying piss from any kind of anal pleasure, and wetting themselves becomes linked to achieving orgasm.

The already existing nervous structure means that sensitivity enhancement is not required as the play is already highly pleasurable when combined with the usual endurance improvements of basic strains.

By removing their ability to hypnotically attract men, and instead giving them the ability to attract and infect animals, the advantages of the siren remain intact without posing danger to research and combat staff. Like most siren strains they have higher than usual intelligence, though not to the point of speech. 
					t ?fetish rim; Notably, echidnas do not use animals strictly for infection and pleasure, and will often spend long periods of time pampering their "children", referring to their infected pets. While typically this includes bending over and being knotted one-by-one by an entire pack of hounds, this also means slowly pleasuring her children with her hands while passionately rimming their asses and moaning like a normal woman would make out with her husband. Though this seems like a waste of infected sperm, hounds treated this way seem to become even stronger and more virile after these milking situations. 
					t ?fetish ws; New children invited into the pack tend to become very attached to their denmother, and often after their first sexual experience with their echidna they will mark her. This seems to result in extreme sexual pleasure for the echidna, who will quickly achieve orgasm by being sprayed with piss. Echidnas with large packs will sometimes even request that the entire pack spray and mark her all at once, cumming extremely hard from her small, unused penis while attempting to drink as much as she can. Hounds involved in this ritual seem to lose respect for their denmother at this point and begin to treat the echidna roughly, much to the denmother's delight.
