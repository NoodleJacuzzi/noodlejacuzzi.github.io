This is Anomaly Vault, an HTML game about you, a researcher at Anomaly Vault, experimenting on reality-bending artifacts for sexual gain. Inspirations come from all around, but the game's structure is owed mostly to The Company and is thematically close to Human Alteration App's dominant route.
I've made a few games now, you can find a link to each of them in my index. If you'd like to support me or try to get more content for some of my games you like, consider supporting my Patreon at https://www.patreon.com/noodlejacuzzi
I don't lock off content, so if you aren't interested you don't lose out on anything. If you'd like your own profile picture in the game, or would like a scene of your own, that's the place to head.

This game uses real porn images and gifs, and covers a variety of fetishes. Check the game's content list to see what each artifact focuses on. 
If you're interested in where the game will be going as progress continues, check out my index in my signature. I have a big list of the artifacts I'll be adding / am considering adding.
The whole game is hand-coded html, and is not made in Twine. The game was designed with images in mind, so some scenes might read clunkily without them.
This game was sponsored by Swallows999 via patreon. He's not a major fan of TF content, so the TF content in the game will primarily be found in a section called the Dark Vault. Check out the planned content roadmap in the index to see if anything really sticks out as interesting to you and I can put it on a front burner.

FAQ:
Q. What are the cheats?
A. Head over to my patreon. The most recent release post will include a list of the game's cheats. The post isn't locked behind a paywall either, non-patrons will be able to see it. Please link to the post instead of pasting the cheats directly.
In addition, please let me know if you have any other cheat ideas. The ones I have are for one-shot artifacts with a humerus tone.

Q. The game is corrupted when I try to extract it!
A. Try updating your extraction program (ie make sure 7zip is up to date)

Q. How would I go about writing a scene of my own?
A. Shoot it over to me. There are a few formatting rules to follow, so you might want to message me first.

Q. Can you add [fetish]?
A. Probably, feel free to let me know what you have in mind. Also check the roadmap on my index (https://noodlejacuzzi.github.io/index.html) for the artifacts I already have planned. I have a lot, so I'd like to focus on the things people are excited over or are fun to write.

Q. Will you add more narrative elements?
A. Probably. Please give suggestions for exactly what you think would work, that'd be most helpful.

This update was held back by an engine overhaul I'm working on. I'm hoping for more movement between areas so that the game feels less like a bunch of menus. I'd like another section of the vault dedicated to useful 'toolbox' artifacts for making gameplay smoother.

The primary fetishes that this patch focuses on are:
Femdom
Free Use
Time-stop
ENF / Embarassed Nude Female
Humiliation

And the dark-vault fetishes are:
Urethral Insertion (sounding)
Ball Growth
Sissification
Prostate Growth
Cock Shrinking

Also included in many scenes are the game's usual themes and sprinklings of unpercieved sex.
Due to the nature of the game, all of the above content is completely optional.
