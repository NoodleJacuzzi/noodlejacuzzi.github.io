This is Anomaly Vault, an HTML game about you, a researcher at Anomaly Vault, experimenting on reality-bending artifacts for sexual gain. Inspirations come from all around, but the game's structure is owed mostly to The Company and is thematically close to Human Alteration App's dominant route.
I've made a few games now, you can find a link to each of them in my index. If you'd like to support me or try to get more content for some of my games you like, consider supporting my Patreon at https://www.patreon.com/noodlejacuzzi
I don't lock off content, so if you aren't interested you don't lose out on anything. If you'd like your own profile picture in the game, or would like a scene of your own, that's the place to head.

This game uses real porn images and gifs, and covers a variety of fetishes. Check the game's content list to see what each artifact focuses on. 
If you're interested in where the game will be going as progress continues, check out my index in my signature. I have a big list of the artifacts I'll be adding / am considering adding.
The whole game is hand-coded html, and is not made in Twine. The game was designed with images in mind, so some scenes might read clunkily without them.
This game was sponsored by Swallows999 via patreon. He's not a major fan of TF content, so the TF content in the game will primarily be found in a section called the Dark Vault. Check out the planned content roadmap in the index to see if anything really sticks out as interesting to you and I can put it on a front burner.

Known issues:
The cheat to unlock all scenes isn't unlocking the research scenes with the Reprehensive Bracelet.

FAQ:
Q. What are the cheats?
A. Head over to my patreon. The most recent release post will include a list of the game's cheats. The post isn't locked behind a paywall either, non-patrons will be able to see it. Please link to the post instead of pasting the cheats directly.
The (most recent) post is here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/29752391
In addition, please let me know if you have any other cheat ideas. The ones I have are for one-shot artifacts with a humerous tone.

Q. The game is corrupted when I try to extract it!
A. Try updating your extraction program (ie make sure 7zip is up to date)

Q. How would I go about writing a scene of my own?
A. Shoot it over to me. There are a few formatting rules to follow, so you might want to message me first.

Q. Can you add [fetish]?
A. Probably, feel free to let me know what you have in mind. Also check the roadmap on my index (https://noodlejacuzzi.github.io/index.html) for the artifacts I already have planned. I have a lot, so I'd like to focus on the things people are excited over or are fun to write.

Q. Will you add more narrative elements?
A. Probably. Please give suggestions for exactly what you think would work, that'd be most helpful.

Version 2.0 - Time Stopwatch & Antique Mirror
New Scenes:
- 10 Antique Mirror scenes (split between a free-use and femdom dimension)
- 7 Time stopwatch scenes
- 4 Dark Vault scenes (gummy dicks, punification cage, and succubus onahole)

Bugfixes / other changes:
- The disable images button is now a toggle. It'll refresh the page for you, which is what actually re-enables the images.
- There's now a warning for the final scene in the Erotibox letting you know it might be a bad idea to stick Veronica in there.
- There are now more cheat codes. See the note in my FAQ or below for more info.
- Unrecognized cheats will no longer give a 'code accepted' message.
- The roadmap on my index has been updated with new artifacts. Feel free to check them out and let me know which ones you'd like to see soon.

On cheat codes (copied from my FAQ):

The primary fetishes that this patch focuses on are:
Femdom
Free Use
Time-stop
ENF / Embarassed Nude Female
Humiliation

And the dark-vault fetishes are:
Urethral Insertion (sounding)
Ball Growth
Sissification
Prostate Growth
Cock Shrinking

Also included in many scenes are the game's usual themes and sprinklings of unpercieved sex.
Due to the nature of the game, all of the above content is completely optional.

This update more than doubles the size of the game, AV is actually almost as large as HAA's dom route now if you discount the endings. I'm hoping to add more narrative elements in the future, feel free to give suggestions.
The winner of the September content poll was for me to focus on more Anomaly Vault for the month, but I'll also be spending some time on the close runner-up, Bitch Medicenter. Please check out its demo if you have the time, I'll be posting it here once v1 is finished. 
I'll be working on that and on Anomaly Vault's V3 for this month, I hope you all enjoy.

You god damn hit my weakspot; SCPs. Hope you do some good parodies of the cool ones. Like a rule 34 zombie virus or the room of flesh or maybe even female Doctor Bright.

I think seperating the work place into different labelled sections or wings (Which you kinda did with the dark artifacts) would make it feel more memorable and also would give accomplishment when someone finishes an entire wing.

Good luck keep it up.

[/QUOTE]

The zombie virus is something I'd like to do. I don't know about the room of flesh though. The plague doctor seems like the one with the most design space.

I like SCPs enough that using them for small references feel like a waste. I reserve the right to turn the joke artifacts into fully fledged ones eventually.

The difficulty with doing wings is that a lot of the content comes from outside the base and from how different each artifact is, but I think I will include more wings in the future. Maybe a wing full of useful tool artifacts, or a prison.

I'll do my best, thank you.

Can someone give a quickrundown on the game ?

[/QUOTE]

I'm not sure I can explain it differently from the synopsis, so I was hoping someone else would.
Basically you pick artifacts from a list with effects "this stops time" and then you watch/read a scene where you use the artifact for adult purposes.

I really did think at one point that adding cheats would be a waste, since nobody would bother with them. I have been proven wrong.
There are more now. Please go to the patreon post here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/29752391
