Intro blurb remarking on your role and mission, probably following up on an ending to the first game where you are promoted to a field agent. 
Select between Midas Coin and the Time Stopwatch.
You can talk with Veronica before you leave. 
Grab Jeeve's Keys, an artifact that gives transportation. Along the way you can read the artifact briefing and talk about where you're going or just nap through it.
Arrive in the rural town, it's pretty empty.
