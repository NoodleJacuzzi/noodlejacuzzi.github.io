				t You're ready to walk right up to her and have your way, but something causes her to perk up. At first you think she somehow noticed you, but then you hear it as well. The stifled moans of someone else in the library.
				...
				im images/bracelet/library1-1.gif
				sp librarian; O-oh my...
				t You take in the kinky exhibitionist's show. What's just as interesting though is librarianF peeking from behind a shelf to watch as well.
				t The exhibitionist is clearly awakening something in librarianF, although that could also be the fact that you're stroking her cunt through her clothes. You make a mental note that the bracelet might be pretty good at giving other people fetishes.
				im images/bracelet/library1-2.gif
				t Using the bracelet to stay unnoticed you grab librarianF's panties and pull them aside, enjoying the fact that she's already completely soaked.
				t librarianF bites down on her knuckle trying to keep her voice under control, but she doesn't even consider taking her eyes away from the exhibitionist in front of her for a second.
				sp librarian; <i>Oh god, what's happening to me? Just from watching... I'm... I'm...</i>
				im images/bracelet/library1-3.gif
				sp librarian; <i>Cumming~!</i>
				t Her legs shake and quiver as she hits an orgasm even stronger than the exhibitionist's. Her eyelids flutter and her stance wavers as she needs to lean on the shelf for support.
				t The woman putting on the show quickly composes herself and starts getting dressed. Panicking that she'll be found librarianF tries to scramble away as well. You leave librarianF to see how she'll develop the next time you see her.

				t You arrive back at the library to find that librarianF isn't at her desk. After a bit of searching you find her neatly organizing books.

				t It's actually pretty cute to see her put down her stack of books and look around to make sure nobody's watching. She lifts up her skirt, but hesitates.
				sp librarian; Jesus... Get ahold of yourself... I shouldn't-
				im images/bracelet/library2-1.gif
				t librarianF gasps as you start preparing her ass for some fun, you might as well get her addicted to anal and rough sex while you're turning her into an exhibitionist.
				t librarianF leans against a bookshelf for support, her mind trying to rationalize what's going on. As far as she knows she's losing control of her body and being overwhelmed by sensations as part of a newly developing kink.
				t You drag her by the hips over to a small table, still making sure nobody will see her partially so you can leave her as a broken mess, but also partially because you want something for her clit to rub against between thrusts.
				t The bracelet still affecting her mind, she can't really be sure why she's moved, all she can really be sure of is that she's horny as fuck.
				im images/bracelet/library2-2.gif
				sp librarian; Ghh~! Ghh~!
				t And that her ass feels incredible. She really is doing her best to hold her voice in. Enjoying the torment, you grab her by the legs to ensure the fetishes you're pounding into her will stick.
				im images/bracelet/library2-3.gif
				sp librarian; Ouuuugh~!
				t In her defense there really isn't a woman alive who could handle this kind of assfucking and stay quiet, although her pussy spasming in the throes of an orgasm is one-hundred percent on her. Just to really drive the point home you keep pounding her well through her orgasm.
				t At this point it's guaranteed that she'll be the next one to start jilling off in the library, and that's kinda your fault, so you do her at least one last good service by lowering her and pulling out. 
				im images/bracelet/library2-4.gif

				sp assistant; Alright, let's do this!
				sp player; You're a lot more chipper then usual.
				sp assistant; Hehe, that's because today will be easy. Because for the first time we're researching an artifact with...<br>Dah dah daaaah~ Instructions! 
				t She holds up a small white pamphlet, titled "The Struggle at the Top; A CEO's New Best Friend. A Full Guide to the CEO's Pass, to maximize dividends and improve equity ratios in..."
				t And the title just goes on and on, dozens of buzzwords, at some point the thing is meaningless to read.
				sp player; Let's not get ahead of ourselves. If the booklet was found with the artifact, the book might be part of the artifact's effects. Lemme read this thing...<br> What the hell? 
				t The first page of the booklet simply reads 'show the card to the designated presenter, then allow 1-2 hours for presentation, followed by the most arcane garbling you' ve ever seen. As you skim through the pages that look more like QR codes put through a blender, you realize you've already hit page 600 of a booklet that's less than an inch thick. It's clearly anomalous, so you pick up the passcode and flash it at assistantF. 
				t She looks confused for a second before her eyes glaze over, her body goes limp, and a forced smile overtakes her face. She stumbles over you like a puppet controlled by an amateur puppetmaster and takes the booklet from you. 
				sp assistant; Congratulations on your purchase of this highly experimental CEO pass, brought to you Seltsame Industries! Though we still lack an official sponsor, hopefully this display of the capabilities of our latest product will show we have what it takes! 
				t The lights of the room somehow dim, and what appears to be a slide presentation is displayed on the blank wall behind assistantF. 
				sp assistant; The crux of the pass is the ability to awaken the inner assistant within your employees. Everyone views the boss above them differently, but in all cases we've shown solid results of near perfect submissive responses towards the CEO. 
				t You take a seat to relax and watch the presentation as assistantF unbuttons her blouse, obviously trying to show cleavage while speaking with much more confidence than usual. 
				sp assistant; Mind-wiping and personality overwrite techniques unfortunately don't cut it in today's climate. A diverse pool of minds leads to better performance overall. <br>Our technology relies on the preferences and fetishes of the individual, combined with a servile persona, to better motivate and satisfy the CEO of a modern world. What business are you running, exactly?
				sp player; I'd really like to just understand how the pass works, so feel free just to focus on whatever satisfaction methods you deem best.
				t There's a sparkle in assistantF's eyes as you say that, and you see the face of the CEO pass shift in color ever so slightly.
				sp player; So, all of my new 'assistants' will have their own preferences on what exactly satisfaction means, yeah? What about this one?
				sp assistant; Hmm... I've got a poor sense of balance and self-awareness, she'll try to make up for it in enthusiasm! 
				t You walk up to assistantF and pinch her on the cheek. She does her best to keep her smile up as you tug, until you let go. 
				sp player; Did that hurt?
				sp assistant; Yes it did, thank you for your concern! Now, essential to the understanding of the pass is the comprehensive legal overview...
				...
				sp assistant; Ugh... What's going on? Is it over?
				t As the presentation finishes assistantF comes back to her senses, only a little disorientated and rubbing her cheek.
				sp notes; The pass is much more obviously artificial than a traditional artifact, even having an entire presentation built in for novice users. The sexual nature of its use depends more on the target than on the user, as each person will show their submission to authority in a different way and subjects seem not to remember what they did while affected by the pass.<br>Practical tests are the best way to examine the artifact, and additional resources dedicated to finding out how the makers of the pass created the artifact is highly recommended.

			sp player; Actually, no. Knowing she's still in there is enough for me. bossL, tear open your pants. 
			im images/pass/research3-1.gif
			sp boss; Without hesitation! Her state of anger is evolving into a level of blind fury, mixed with heavy levels of shame. Please keep in mind what while assistants keep no memory of their actions, they may subconciously harbor feelings of anger or arousal afterwards. 
			sp player; That's fantastic! Ah, was she not wearing panties today? 
			sp boss; They were removed recently to allow for anal masturbation in the men's bathroom! <br>Ah, shame levels have risen dramatically. 
			sp player; Well, I guess I know what she wants at least. Get ready.
			im images/pass/research3-2.gif
			sp boss; Absolutely! Please do not worry about the comfort of assistants, what matters most is your satisfaction! And personal feelings of arousal strongly suggest that even if this assistant were not already lubed up from self pleasure, she would still achieve climax from anal fucking.

			t You thrust in, feeling the warmth of her ass. There's a flicker of something behind her glazed-over eyes, like her true self was struggling to break free for a second, but it's quickly gone and bossL happily hums a tune as you fuck her ass.
			sp boss; It is worth noting that her ass and anal fetish are already highly developed. Do you find this to your liking? I could suck your dick to ensure a more lubed experience, her reaction to that idea is quit positive behind her forced rage.
			sp player; M-maybe another... Time... God she's tight, I'm not gonna last long...
			sp boss; Fantastic! Remember this assistant is completely devoted to your pleasure. Not only that, but she will not last much longer either before achieving release. Her inner voice is mostly a chorus of moans at this point.
			sp player; Gonna...
			sp boss; I can sense you are close. I will forcibly trigger an orgasm to ensure maximum tightness.

			sp boss; Release achieved! She is cumming, both from the rough anal stimulation and the feeling of sperm flooding her ass. Good job!
			t You keep thrusting away trying to ride out the orgasm as her ass clenches around you, until you fire off your last load and pull out. Her ass clenches, doing its damnedest to hold in your load.
			sp boss; On the inside you could consider her to be unconscious, like she fainted. Shall I return to her office and release control? Ah, should I clean out the cum from her ass as well?
